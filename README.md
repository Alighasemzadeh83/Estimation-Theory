# Estimation Theory

📚 **Course taught by Dr. Rouhollah Amiri**

This repository contains my notes, assignments, and implementations from the *Estimation Theory* course.  
It covers both classical and modern estimation techniques, frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and advanced filtering methods.
